	<h1>OWTF Help</h1>
	<p>This file contains explanations and tips on how to configure and use OWTF</p>
	<!-- Each anchor has a topic that will be linked to from the report -->
	<h2><a href="#Configuration" name="Configuration">Configuration Intro</a></h2>
		<p>OWTF's behaviour will depend on how it is called but also on how it was configured <br />
		Configuration is performed via files called <a href="#Profiles">"profiles"</a><br />
	<h2><a href="#Profiles" name="Profiles">Configuration Profiles</a></h2>
		<p>The idea of the profiles is that the user should be able to define different profiles for different tests as they wish: <br />
		There is an experimental option in the command line to load a profile from a specific file location.  <br />
		So, depending of the kind of tests you are doing you can define a different way to run tools, set defaults, etc <br />
		<br />
		IMPORTANT: You should backup the file prior to modifying it + backup the profiles directory _always_, before upgrading OWTF.  <br />
		NOTE: The configuration file defaults to Backtrack paths for the simple reason that most tools are already there (convenience) <br />
		<br />
		Regarding the use of Backtrack over other Linux options, that is personal preference: <br />
		You will have a little bit less configuration changes to make on Backtrack (more convenience), that is all.  <p>
		At the moment OWTF has the following configuration files:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#profilegeneraldefault">owtf_dir/profiles/general/default.cfg</a>: General configuration: Tool locations, Icons for review, Default settings, etc</li>
			<li><a href="#profileresourcesdefault">owtf_dir/profiles/resources/default.cfg</a>: Defines how tools will be run + external links to useful resources and online tools</li>
			<li><a href="#profilewebpluginorderdefault">owtf_dir/profiles/web_plugin_order/default.cfg</a>: Defines the order in which web plugins will be run</li>
			<li><a href="#frameworkconfig">owtf_dir/framework/config/framework_config.cfg</a>: Internal framework configuration (you can break a lot here, backup first!!)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><a href="#profilegeneraldefault" name="profilegeneraldefault">Config file: owtf_dir/profiles/general/default.cfg</a></h3>
			<p>General configuration: Tool locations, Icons for review, Default settings, etc</p>
		<h3><a href="#profileresourcesdefault" name="profileresourcesdefault">Config file: owtf_dir/profiles/resources/default.cfg</a></h3>
			<p>Defines how tools will be run + external links to useful resources and online tools</p>
		<h3><a href="#profilewebpluginorderdefault" name="profilewebpluginorderdefault">Config file: owtf_dir/profiles/web_plugin_order/default.cfg</a></h3>
			<p>Defines the order in which web plugins will be run</p>
		<h3><a href="#frameworkconfig" name="frameworkconfig">Config file: owtf_dir/framework/config/framework_config.cfg</a></h3>
			<p>Internal framework configuration (you can break a lot here, backup first!!)</p>
	<h2><a href="#ReviewSize" name="ReviewSize">Review Storage Size</a></h2>
		<p>The review can be stored in two ways: <a href="#ReviewlocalStorage">HTML5 localStorage</a> (recommended and default) or <a href="#Reviewwindow.name">window.name</a> (for old browsers)<br />
		Why should you care? <u>If you store screenshots in the review you probably want to increase the default HTML5 localStorage size in your browser!</u></p>
		<h3><a href="#ReviewlocalStorage" name="ReviewlocalStorage">Review on HTML5 localStorage</a></h3>
			<p><a href="#profilegeneraldefault">OWTF config setting</a>: JAVASCRIPT_STORAGE: owtf_localStorage.js<br />
			Features: Most browsers have a default 5MB limit, Data persistence: screen refresh + closing browser, From FF 8.0 using file:// (before FF 8.0: only worked on http://)<br />
			<b>In Firefox localStorage is configurable</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Modify size: Go to <a href="" target="_blank">about:config</a> and search for "dom.storage.default_quota" option. It's value is in KB. <a href="http://arty.name/localstorage.html" target="_blank">More info here</a></li>
				<li>Review localStorage content: <a href="http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2012/01/exploring-your-browser-localstorage.html" target="_blank">Blog post</a> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foundstone-html5-local-storage/" target="_blank">Firefox plugin</a></li>
			</ul> 
		<h3><a href="#Reviewwindow.name" name="Reviewwindow.name">Review on window.name</a></h3>
			<p><a href="#profilegeneraldefault">OWTF config setting</a>: JAVASCRIPT_STORAGE: sessvars.js,owtf_sessvars.js<br />
			Features: Most browsers have a default 2MB limit, Data persistence: screen refresh only, cannot be configured (afaik) but works on old browsers</p>
